To celebrate our CSAs, and in conjunction with International Volunteers Day last week, we held an appreciation event where it was their turn to be treated. Besides a delicious lunch, they were also able to relax through massages, and engage their inner child through handicrafts and old-school games like snakes and ladders and marbles.

With support from their social workers, the youths designed and manned the event booth, demonstrating that community service knows no age barriers. Funded by Changi Foundation CAG s philanthropic arm since 2015, the Youth COP programme aims to cultivate resilient youths who actively lead in crime prevention within their communities.

Some of them even include attached onsen hot spring facilities - another highlight in Kyoto.

The difference between ryokans and onsens Ryokans had their beginnings in wayfarers - catering to passing travellers on foot, which included samurai and tradesmen moving between Tokyo and Kyoto. The first ever to appear was Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan in 705 CE, and amazingly, is still in operation today. It remains as the oldest ryokan in Japan, and also holds the title as the longest continuously-running hotel in the world.

Some ryokans don t have onsens, and some onsens are dedicated facilities with no overnight options. In fact, because of the therapeutic properties of hot spring water, many choose to visit standalone onsens regularly for its health benefits. A typical onsen is a communal affair, with several large sharing pools, each boasting different natural minerals and temperatures for its purported healing properties. They often come with lockers and changing rooms for both genders, and can sometimes include a restaurant or massage services on premise.

Private onsen baths can be found too, but these will usually be attached to a ryokan. Travellers may also have reservations about going to private open-air baths or outdoor onsens, but rest assured that the bath will typically be surrounded by a high wall to prevent nosy onlookers. Another common point of confusion is mistaking sentos public baths for onsens. Though similar in format with their lockers and hot communal public baths, sentos are utilitarian hot baths with no natural minerals in their waters while onsens are more akin to that spa visit. They were built as early facilities for those with homes without private baths, but as time went by, owners started adding herbs, minerals and water jets as upgrades, which made them have their own benefits.

Named one of the top hangover cures by National Geographic UK, this soup dish is boiled with various spices and is served with brown rice, making it a unique and flavourful Korean soup. When ordering, the waiter will ask you if you want sliced green chilli and spring onions, which add to the fragrance but may make it too spicy for those with low spice tolerance. Most bowls are served with a half-boiled egg and salted seaweed. Mix the egg well with a few spoons of Kongnamul broth and enjoy the delicious bowl of egg, where the broth enhances the flavour of the egg instead of the other way around. For meat lovers, add boiled squid to your soup.

We thank Jewel for this unique opportunity to engage deeper connections and create memorable experiences for all visitors. Made up of more than 900 trees and palms and about 60,000 shrubs, the curation of the indoor forest took concerted effort.

Applying these optimal growth conditions eventually resulted in the dynamic forest experience and selection of plants that visitors will see in Jewel. The 4-storey incline of the Shiseido Forest Valley also influenced the types of flora selected.
